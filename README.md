### Hi there, I'm Patrick 👋

I am a Junior Data Scientist who loves to learn. This GitHub page showcases projects and work I have completed.

I love being faced with a challenge and working to find a solution. I graduated with a Philosophy degree, where I studied Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. This course showed me the power of data science and artificial intelligence and introduced me to some of the ethical discussions happening in the field. I was employed as a data analyst at a FinTech - the role was loosely defined and gave me the scope to teach myself Python and SQL to build automation tools. Afterwards, I switched to being a project lead at a marketing agency - in this role I led client meetings and presented analytical insights to non-technical external stakeholders based on data analysis completed by our internal teams. I wanted to switch back to a more technical role because I found I missed using the hard skills I had developed. 

Next, I want to work in a collaborative team where mentoring new members of the team is a core part of the culture. I would also like to have the opportunity to teach and mentor as well as learn.

🧘‍♂️ Focusing on improving my dashboarding skills in Tableau and learning Ruby.

🔭 I’m currently working on a cybersecurity data science project; analysing network traffic, can I develop an ML algorithm to identify cyber attacks. I want to use this project as a spring board to learn more about cybersecurity.
