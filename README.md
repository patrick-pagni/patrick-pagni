### Hi there, I'm Patrick ðŸ‘‹

My career has been defined by taking opportunities where I can develop my engineering skills and understanding of AI systems. The overarching goal was to transition from my philosophy undergraduate degree to completing a masters in artificial intelligence, which I completed this year. This masterâ€™s has given me a strong understanding of the mathematical foundations of AI systems, as well as having exposed me to deep learning frameworks; LLM APIs; and probabilistic programming languages.

Beyond improving my technical expertise, I have also developed my skills at project management and delivery. While working at Ravelin Technology I led a project to develop a bespoke data visualization dashboard monitoring client performance and spotlighting poorly performing clients. This involved pitching the project to management to gain approval; breaking the project down into individual tickets and assigning them to members of the project team; assisting with developing the tool itself; and presenting the new tool to stakeholders at different levels, including C-suite.

I am looking for opportunities to work on high-impact projects while continuing to develop my expertise in productionalizing Artificial Intelligence systems.
